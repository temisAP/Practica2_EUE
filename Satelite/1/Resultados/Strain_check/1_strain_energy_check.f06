     MSC Nastran 2020 SP1 corrects four defects, evident in version 2020,
     that concern the import of Nastran Embedded Fatigue and acoustic pressure
     results into Patran, corrects a licensing defect concerning the
     TABLRPC entry, and shell elements SFRP failure indicator output in
     the Digimat-to-SOL 400 MATDIGI interface.

       analysis.
     - New stress/strain output requests via FATIGUE case control.
     - More control over the amound of results data returned at critical
       locations.
     - Significant performance improvement of SOL 112 duty cycle jobs.
     - Direct access to dynamic load data in multi-channel time histroy files via
       new TABLRPC entry.
  
     Topology Optimization
     - Anisotropic materials support added.
     - Over-hang constraints for additive manufacturing.
     - New DRESP2 response types: Magnigtude of Displacement and
       maximization of stiffness and frequency.

     Nonlinear
     - Nonlinear Buckling available in SOL 400
     - Allow represtentation of imperfect structural geometry through
       use modification of grid coordinates based on displacements or
       modes from a previous run.
     - MATVE limitation of five scale factor/time constraint data pairs
       removed.
  
     HPC
     - CASI (Iterative) Solver support available for inertia relief analysis.
     - Faster Global Transformation Matrix for ACMS to speed up Nastran
       interface to MSC Adams and AVL EXCITE.

     IF THE MODEL HAS PASSED THE PREVIOUS CHECKS FOR THE G-SET AND N-SET,
     THEN SOME POSSIBLE CAUSES ARE:
       1. THE MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE FREE-FREE WHICH INDICATES THAT THE MODEL IS
          PROPERLY CONSTRAINED TO GROUND;
       2. THE REFERENCE GRID POINT (GRID=GID ON THE GROUNDCHECK COMMAND) IS LOCATED
          TOO FAR FROM THE MODEL'S CENTER OF GRAVITY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE
          REFERENCE GRID POINT BE LOCATED AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE MODEL'S CENTER
          OF GRAVITY OF THE MODEL (SEE THE GRID POINT WEIGHT GENERATOR OUTPUT);
       3. PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES CONSTRAINS NEAR-SINGULAR DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM. WHEN A
          FINITE ELEMENT MODEL WITH AUTOSPC FAILS THE A-SET CHECK, IT IS NOT EVIDENT
          THAT GROUNDING HAS OCCURRED. THE USE OF PARAM,SNORM WILL NOT ELIMINATE THE
          SPURIOUS FAILURE.
